# SkyLeap

Useful To Do app that also displays the current weather and Nasa's Astronomy picture of the day.

Currently in it's build stage. 

(Will post updates as it comes along.)

current: No weather yet, Fetching and populating Nasa's image, working on populating textView.
Must use own API key in the API_ADDRESS string inside features.features/space/SpaceFragment.java. In
order for it to work, you must append "&date=" to your key string.

Looking to optimize the time taken to populate Image views.
