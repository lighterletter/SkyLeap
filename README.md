# SkyLeap
Android productivity app. 

Useful To Do list that also displays the current weather and Nasa's APOD (Astronomy picture of the day).

Currently in it's build stage. 

(Will post updates as it comes along.)

current: Weather works in celcious. Display and notification. But clikcing the individual nodes causes the app to crash. The astronomy and todo list are still unimplemented.

Busy with other projects. Will update as time becomes available.
